<b>Collaboration among Students:</b>
</td>
<td align="justify">
We encourage collaboration between students and studying materials in groups when the purpose of this is to facilitate learning, not to circumvent problems. It is allowed to seek help from other students in understanding the material needed to solve a particular problem. However, students must submit individual material and solutions, unless otherwise specified. Students should declare any collaboration on the first page of homework assignments (or equivalently on exercises). If the instructors believe the collaboration is improper, your grade may be affected. <br><br>

<b>Use of LLM/VLMs (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.):

</td>

We encourage you to use ChatGPT to solve the homework assignment problems (because likely in the future everyone will use it for coding). However, you will need to declare using ChatGPT/LLMs in the homework README, as well as the prompts you use. But you are not allowed to use LLM for in-class test!!!
